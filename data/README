Name of the data (1):
Green Infrastructure Water Capactiy

Description:
Green infrastructure is designed to capture and infiltrate or filter stormwater runoff through natural systems. 
This dataset is used in combination with precipitation numbers to update the stormwater dashboard (in progress) and Sustainable City pLAn. 
It is refreshed as new projects are created. I can use this data to show which areas have suffiecient green infrastructure to handle water loads in the future for my project on water quality, safety and accessibility.
